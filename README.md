# zorkdemo
Runs on Linux, Windows or Mac.

A (much simplified) port of a famous adventure game to help teach my daughter how to program in Python.

Two ways to launch the project:
1. Download the source code, and, from a console window, type `python main.py` to start the game -- provided you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
2. Download one of the binary releases and run the file on your system. 

NOTE: the MacOS version does not have code signing built into it yet (that's next on my list!). To run it, you will need to set the binary as executable with `chmod 755` or similar, and after trying to run it once, go through System Preferences: Security and Privacy: General and "Allow the program to run anyway".
